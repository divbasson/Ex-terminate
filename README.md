## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/facebook-photo-cleanup.git
   cd facebook-photo-cleanup
   ```

2. Edit the script to add your Facebook Developer credentials:
   - Open `script.py` and replace placeholders:
     ```python
     APP_ID = 'your_app_id'
     APP_SECRET = 'your_app_secret'
     REDIRECT_URI = 'your_redirect_url'
     ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your_access_token'
     ```

3. Generate a User Access Token:
   - Use the Facebook Developer Tools to generate a long-lived access token for testing.

   ```

2. Follow the interactive prompts:
