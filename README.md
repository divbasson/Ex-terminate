# Ex-terminate
This Python script automates managing Facebook photos tagged with a specific ex-partner. It connects to Facebook's Graph API to fetch tagged photos, filters them by a specified friend, and allows the user to hide, delete, untag, or skip each photo, updating privacy settings as chosen. Ideal for managing digital memories with ease.
